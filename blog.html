           <p>
              Or How did I get to pursue a life in front of a computer?<br>
              My name is Yoav, I'm 32 years old. A junior web developer, and very serious about getting to the top of this exciting and fast changing working environment. <br>
           </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              I've been traveling for more than a year around the world, and I was working in some very odd jobs. <br>
              Some of them, where Real estate broker in Tel-Aviv, an organic agricultural produce distributer and sales man.<br>
              A dive master on the Great Barrier Reef, And I even worked as a shepherd for a few months.<br>
            </p>

          <li>
            <p>
              I come from the northern part of Israel, where most people work in basic slow pasting jobs like agriculture and education. And there is really nothing wrong about that, but if you live in that kind of environment, you need to really like that way of life. <br>
              My problem was, that I never really like staying at one place for too long. it’s a problem with my generation in general.<br>
              But for me in particular, I was getting really board, but I did not have the set of tools to get a job in the real world.<br>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              As a matter affect, I went to study B.Sc. in environmental science. Which after completing the studies, I never wanted to see the inside part of a lab, ever again.<br>
              And from then on, it was just trying anything that seemed interesting to me, most of the time, I've never seen an inside of an office. 
            </p>

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              My point is, I didn't plan to be a web developer, it's something I never seen myself doing, most of my working life, I was kind of winging it.<br> 
              But my last job, (The current one for now), Is an application specialist in a Hospital IT department. And I got to this position after working as an implementer on a radiologist software (RIS-Radiology Information System) in the hospital.<br>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              And I got really interested in how things work in the background, how to build things by myself, and how to fix them.<br>
              So I started to learn a lot by myself, first I browsed the web for any piece of info on the subject, and after a few months I started a course in Netcraft academy, which is an Israeli school for Front-End Wev Developing and UX,UI.
           </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              This is the roadmap for the process I did, from the first YouTube I watched on web developing, to my first job position in the field.<br> 
              Hopefully this will help you, find the way to learn from my mistakes, be a better developer, and even giving you tools to get your first job.
